title: Simple Numerical Integration Techniques with Python
---

In today's post I want to make available a little paper that was part of the
requirements for our programming class in the first semester of Mathematics.

The topic I chose was 'Numerical Integration' and any programming had to be
done using Python. I had a lot of fun sitting down and work on the project as it
allowed me to dive a little more into python again as well as to finally learn
LaTeX's incredibly versatile and powerful (although sometimes a bit hard to
understand) graphics capabilities. <br/>

The article is available [here](/files/NumerischeIntegration_MarcelKropp.pdf) (unfortunately only in German).
