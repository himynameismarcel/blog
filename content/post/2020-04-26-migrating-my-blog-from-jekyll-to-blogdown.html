<p>About two years ago I had decided to finally start my own blog. I knew that I wanted to use a static site generator (with its obvious advantages and easy maintainability) and so after researching for various alternatives and having narrowed it down to the choice between <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">pelikan</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> and their easy compatibility with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github (pages)</a>, I ultimately decided to use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>. While I did have some background in html, css and javascript, I remember that it did take me a few days to finally set up my blog with jekyll. While the resources are plenty (I actually should have written a dedicated blog-post back then about how I set up my blog to remember exactly everything), I do remember that the video series on Jekyll provided by the guys from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1itpPvFWHI&amp;list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB">Giraffe Academy</a> had helped me the most. I hosted the final result on <a href="https://github.com/himynameismarcel/himynameismarcel.github.io">github</a> which powered my final web-page at <a href="https://himynameismarcel.github.io/">himynameismarcel.github.io</a>.</p>
<p>While I did not write a dedicated blog-post about how I’ve set up my blog two years ago, I did take a few notes in a notebook friends had given to me upon my departure (see the below picture for the front-matter of the notebook :P).</p>

<p>In there I found the following resources that I’ve read</p>
