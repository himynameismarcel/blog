## Hi, my name is Marcel! ##

I am an Austro-Iranian Economist and grew up in the Alps drinking tea. Throughout my diploma studies (during which the term <em>data scientist</em> was not yet well established/known) I made my fateful encounter with Econometrics[^1] after which one thing led to the other: I caught fire and dived into the subject in the course of a Master's program in <em>Applied Economics</em> which soon brought me in contact with R[^2] and at the same time taught me the beauty of programming.

While I never really understood the value of blogging, in a job interview for a position as an analyst I was asked if I could show some stuff I was working on. And because I could not (apart from two[^3] articles that I co-authored), I became aware of the purpose of a dedicated online portfolio[^4].

The last missing puzzle piece that finally made me sit down and create a blog was an article published on [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/advice-to-aspiring-data-scientists-start-a-blog/">R-bloggers</a>) by Dave Robinson which originally appeared on his own blog on [varianceexplained.org](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/">varianceexplained.org</a>). The argument was convincing: blogging can foster your own learning-path and journey throughout topics of your own interest. And by writing and publishing something you make sure to research to your best knowledge about a certain topic. At the same time you expose yourself to a huge community through which you can connect to peers and receive valuable feedback.</p>

This blog is hence dedicated to my journey through all things <em>economics</em>, <em>data</em> (using primarily R and Python) as well as <em>programming</em> more general.

## Professional Experience ##
During my studies I've had the chance to be involved in my university's teaching (Public Economics, Microeconomics) before starting my professional career with an internship at the Economic Studies Divison of the [Austrian National Bank](https://www.oenb.at/) (Vienna, Austria). After switching to the [European Central Bank's DG-Statistics](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/html/index.en.html) (Frankfurt a. M., Germany) for about two years (first as a Trainee for 12 months, then continuing as an Analyst), I am with [EY](https://www.ey.com/de_de)'s Quantitative Adivisory Services-Team (also Frankfurt a. M.) since July 2018 where I am working with financial institutions mostly on topics related to credit risk (and risk management more general).


## Economics in the 21st Century ##
Besides my current work in risk management and my passion for programming and econometrics/data science, starting with my time at university macroeconomic matters were and are at the heart of my thought and contemplation. Having studied economics during the Financial Crisis I got drawn into matters related to monetary policy and fiscal policy as they dominated the debate between 2008 and 2015. \
Macroeconomics (and economic theory more generally), however, has had a somewhat *strange* development when looking back at the past 100 years in that the (until then) classical theories of economics where actually falsified in the course of the Great Depression of the 1930s (most notably by a British Economist called John Maynard Keynes). This *scientific revolution* (as [Peter Bofinger](https://www.socialeurope.eu/fridays-for-keynesianism) calls it) was, unfortunately, successfully defeated and classical economics resurrected with its neo-classical agenda to determine both the public opinion/debate and economics curricula worldwide to this day. As Bofinger aptly formulates, the fundamental differences are due to the *different modelling of the financial system* where neo-classical theory clearly neglects the (empirically observable) functioning of our modern monetary economies and the relationships between savings, investments and debt. This, unfortunately, has far-reaching implications about drawn conclusions and policy-recommendations in the field of monetary policy and fiscal policy. I will hence also gladly use this platform to elaborate on these issues but want to stress that all opinions expressed are entirely my own.


## In My Spare Time ##
Besides my work I'm also a passionate musician. I play the piano and guitar and dedicated a lot of my time to making music in various bands/projects for more than ten years between 2003 and 2014. When starting to work and leaving for Vienna and subsequently Frankfurt a.M. consequently also my time available for making music decreased, but I still have my guitar with me wherever I go and enjoy playing it like at day one. If I ever manage I will also try to make some of my music available via this blog as soon as I have decided for a good way to do so.</p>
