## Hi, my name is Marcel! ##

I am an Austro-Iranian Economist and grew up in the Alps drinking tea. Throughout my diploma studies (during which the term <em>data scientist</em> was not yet well established/known) I made my fateful encounter with Econometrics[^1] after which one thing led to the other: I caught fire and dived into the subject in the course of a Master's program in <em>Applied Economics</em> which soon brought me in contact with R[^2] and at the same time taught me the beauty of programming.

While I never really understood the value of blogging, in a recent job interview for a position as an analyst I was asked if I could show some stuff I was working on. And because I could not (apart from two[^3] articles that I co-authored), I became aware of the purpose of a dedicated online portfolio[^4].

The last missing puzzle piece that finally made me sit down and create a blog was an article published on [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/advice-to-aspiring-data-scientists-start-a-blog/">R-bloggers</a>) by David Robinson which originally appeared on his own blog on [varianceexplained.org](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/">varianceexplained.org</a>). The argument was convincing: blogging can foster your own learning-path and journey throughout topics of your own interest. And by writing and publishing something you make sure to research to your best knowledge about a certain topic. At the same time you expose yourself to a huge community through which you can connect to peers and receive valuable feedback.</p>

This blog is hence dedicated to my journey through all things <em>economics</em>, <em>data</em> (using primarily R and Python) as well as <em>programming</em> more general.

## Professional Experience ##
During my studies I've had the chance to be involved in my university's teaching (Public Economics, Microeconomics) before starting my professional career with an internship at the Economic Studies Divison of the [Austrian National Bank](https://www.oenb.at/) (Vienna, Austria). After switching to the [European Central Bank's DG-Statistics](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/html/index.en.html) (Frankfurt a. M., Germany) for close to two years (first as a Trainee for 12 months, continuing as an Analyst), I am with [EY](https://www.ey.com/de_de)'s Quantitative Adivisory Services-Team (also Frankfurt a. M.) since July 2018 where I am mostly working on topics related to credit risk.
Hence, all opinions expressed in this blog are entirely my own.


## In My Spare Time ##
Besides my work and all of the above, I'm also a passionate musician. I play the piano and make music in various bands/projects. If I ever manage I will also try to make some of music available via this blog as soon as I have decided for a good way to do so.</p>
